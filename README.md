This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed by the CodeSoft Intern. We've tackled a variety of problems to showcase our data analysis and predictive modeling skills.

## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
The Titanic survival prediction project is a classic binary classification problem. We analyze passenger data to predict whether a passenger survived or not during the Titanic disaster. This project provides a detailed introduction to feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

### Key Files
