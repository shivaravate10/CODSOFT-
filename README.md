# CodeSoft Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed by the CodeSoft team. We've tackled a variety of problems to showcase our data analysis and predictive modeling skills.

## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
The Titanic survival prediction project is a classic binary classification problem. We analyze passenger data to predict whether a passenger survived or not during the Titanic disaster. This project provides a detailed introduction to feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

### Key Files
- `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `titanic_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing.


## Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction

### Overview
In this project, we delve into the world of recommendation systems. We build a predictive model to estimate movie ratings for users based on their historical preferences. We've used collaborative filtering techniques and developed a user-friendly movie recommendation system.

### Key Files
- `movie_rating_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code, data analysis, and recommendation system implementation.
- `movie_ratings_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation.

## Project 3: IRIS Classification

### Overview
In this project, we demonstrate a classic classification problem using the IRIS dataset. Our goal is to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. We've used popular machine learning algorithms and provided detailed code and documentation to help you understand the process.

### Key Files
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete code and analysis.
- `iris_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing.
